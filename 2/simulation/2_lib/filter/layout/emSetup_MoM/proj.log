Substrate calculation finished
Automatically determined a snap distance of
0.0021 mil for layout healing.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout healing changed the layout. The actual
highest aggregate snap distance was 0.0001 mil.
Further details have been written to the DRC
report.

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Layout is electrically large above 1.43 GHz (space wave radiation)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- WARNING -------------------------------------------------------------------

Substrate is electrically large above 8.13 GHz (surface wave radiation)
RF simulation can be less accurate as it ignores radiation
Consider:  - lowering the maximum frequency
           - simulating in MW mode
